All about me

## Who is Ryan?


## Motivation for this document
I want you to understand how I work, and that I am here for you. 

## My role
As a Team Lead of an Agile development team, I am responsible for bringing together a team united around delivering value. I am here as a mentor, a partner for pair programming, a sounding board, and a coach.

## What do I value most?
I value collaboration, both between members of our team and with the teams around us that make up Application Services. Respectful conversations, owning our faults, and empathy are keys to success when dealing with conflicts. I value the team holding me accountable, and following up with me to ensure they get what they need from me.

## My Expectations
A message on Slack is often the best way to get my attention. If I can, I will drop what I am doing to talk with you. Please let me know if you think it will be a conversation longer than 15 minutes, and if it is, feel free to find an opening in my calendar and booking that time. I am not a fan of solving problems over e-mail, and always prefer to have a face to face (or Teams) conversation. While our O3s are a regularly scheduled time to have a chat with me, donâ€™t feel that you ever have to wait for that time.

- I expect you to be available during our core hours, which are from 9 am to 3 pm.
- I expect you to find a good symbiosis between work and the rest of your life. Take care of you and yours, but take the job seriously.
- I expect dialog between yourself and the rest of the team. I encourage pairing, and honest and respectful peer review.

## O3s
I hold O3s (One-On-One) with each team member every two weeks. I will often come with a question of the bi-weekly in order to spark some conversation, but this is your moment with me. Please come prepared with questions, comments and/or concerns that you may have. This time can be used to help resolve issues with your growth and development, define and monitor your progress on your goals, and discuss improvements with your performance.

## Personality quirks
I tend to remember a lot of information down the raod, but I don't necessarily remember things that were talked about 5 minutes prior. Please feel free to follow up with me if you have given me an action item and I have not gotten back to you.

I find that things are often simpler in my own head, than they are in reality, and I appreciate a reality check every now and then.

If a problem is particularly perplexing, I've been told I start to act like Dr. Gregory House.

Although introverted by nature, I respect the value that a conversation with faces and voices brings, and a 5 minute chat can easily be worth a 15 minute Slack chat, or a 2 hour e-mail exchange. By order of preference, I prefer to communicate in-person, via Slack, Microsoft Teams, e-mail, and if you can find them, carrier pigeon.
