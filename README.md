All about me

## My role
As the Solution Architect, I am responsible for aligning technology and our solutions, with the problems our organization is trying to solve. I am here as a mentor, a partner for pair programming, a sounding board, and a coach.

## What do I value most?
### Growth
I see a lack of knowledge and understanding as a stepping stone. I value not knowing something, or lacking experience, and rising to the challenge of learning it. I'm not afraid to say what I don't know, and will approach problems with curiosity and likely excitement (yes, even if production is down), not stress and trepidation. I want to be a little bit smarter tomorrow, than I was today. I want to fail a little less every day.

### Competence
I value being able to do hard things, and continual improvement. Competence is a Jacob's ladder, you're always climbing. The journey towards competence has more meaning for me than the outcome.

### Respect
I value collaboration, between members of our team and with the teams around us. Respectful conversations, owning our faults, and empathy are keys to success when dealing with conflicts. I value the team holding me accountable and following up with me to ensure they get what they need from me.

## My hours
Typically, Monday, Wednesday and Thursday, my work hours begin at 8:00, and I will go until 4:15 or 4:30 depending on how long of a lunch I take. Tuesday and Friday, I tend to start between 7 and 8, and finish my day earlier.

## My Expectations
- I expect you to be available during our morning meeting and project standup, which occurs every day at 9am and 9:45am. Given that we work a 7.25 hour day, I also expect you to find a start time and end time that work for you, while meeting this commitment.
- I expect you to find symbiosis between work and the rest of your life. One affects the other.
- I expect dialog between yourself and the rest of the team. I encourage pairing, and honest and respectful peer review.
- A message on Teams is often the best way to get my attention. If I can, I will drop what I am doing to talk with you. I am not a fan of solving problems over e-mail and prefer to have a face to face (or Teams) conversation. While our O3s are a regularly scheduled time to have a chat with me, donâ€™t feel that you have to wait for that time.
- We're all problem solvers at our core. However, asking for a consult or a sounding board from your peers is a sign of strength and maturity, not weakness. Try to find a solution but understand when you may have stalled and need some help.
- I want to foster an evironment where it's "safe to be dumb". Not knowing something is okay. Not filling that gap in some fashion is unacceptable. Ask questions, do research,  rely on your team, rely on your peers.
- Respect our team's working agreement.
- I respect the value that a conversation with faces and voices brings, and a 5 minute chat can easily be worth a set of chat messages spread out over 15 minutes, or a 2 hour e-mail exchange. By order of preference, I prefer to communicate in-person, via Microsoft Teams, e-mail, and, as a last resort (if you can find them), carrier pigeon.

## O3s
I hold O3s (One-On-One) with each team member every two weeks. I will often come with a question of the bi-weekly to spark some conversation, but this is your moment with me. Please come prepared with questions, comments and/or concerns that you may have. This time can be used to resolve issues with your growth and development, define and monitor your progress on your goals, and discuss improvements with your performance. This time does not have to just focus on what is happening within the office. You're a person with interests, goals, friends, and family, and I want to get to know you.

## Personality quirks
- I tend to remember a lot of information down the road, but I don't always remember things that were talked about 5 minutes prior. Please follow up with me if you have given me an action item and I have not gotten back to you.
- Problems are often simpler in my own head, in contrast to reality, and I appreciate a reality check every now and then.
- If a technical problem is particularly perplexing, I've been told I start to act like Dr. Gregory House, and refuse to let it go until it is solved.
- I have been told that people are surprised when I tell them I am introverted. My personal philosophy on introversion vs. extroversion is, that governs how you react under stress, and not necessarily your day to day interactions. Because of that, the title of Extroverted Introvert, or Outgoing Introvert, makes the most sense to me. https://introvertdear.com/news/extroverted-introvert-signs/
- Context switching is difficult for me. I will often put in blocks of focused time into my calendar in order to ensure I can get things done. If I am going to be doing that, I will annouce it during a morning standup, and when I will be checking messages.
